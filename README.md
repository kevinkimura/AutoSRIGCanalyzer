First run the GCAutoAnalyzerCALIBRATIONS.m code to generate calibration curve data (Autogenerated_Calibration.csv)
This will need to be redone for any different GC.

Then, read the CO2RAutoAnalyzer.doc for details on the user inputs for the CO2RAutoAnalyzer.m code.
It may be easiest to duplicate the processing code for each experimental set and change the inputs accordingly for each experiment.
The auto-analysis code should not be run unless the user understands the code and knows what should be changed depending on the experimental conditions.
